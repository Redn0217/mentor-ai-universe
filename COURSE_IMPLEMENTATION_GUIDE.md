## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run the Database Population Script

```bash
# In your Supabase SQL Editor, run:
comprehensive-python-course.sql
```

This script will:
- Update the main Python course with comprehensive metadata
- Create 8 detailed modules with proper learning objectives
- Add 8+ lessons with rich markdown content
- Include 8+ interactive coding exercises
- Set all content as `is_published = true`

### Step 2: Verify the Implementation

After running the script, verify:

1. **Course Overview**: Visit `/course/python` to see the enhanced course page
2. **Module Structure**: Check that all 8 modules are visible
3. **Lesson Content**: Ensure lessons have rich content with code examples
4. **Exercises**: Verify that exercises have starter code and solutions

### Step 3: Test the User Experience

1. **Navigation**: Test module and lesson navigation
2. **Progress Tracking**: Verify progress bars work correctly
3. **Content Display**: Check that markdown renders properly
4. **Code Highlighting**: Ensure syntax highlighting works

## 🎨 Design Features

### **Platform Color Theme Integration**
- **Primary Orange** (#F15A29): Action buttons, progress indicators
- **Secondary Teal** (#007C87): Completion states, learning objectives  
- **Accent Red-Orange** (#EF3B24): Advanced difficulty indicators

### **Modern UI Components**
- Interactive module cards with progress tracking
- Rich lesson viewer with syntax highlighting
- Comprehensive course overview with statistics
- Professional difficulty level indicators

### **Learning Experience Features**
- Estimated duration for each module/lesson
